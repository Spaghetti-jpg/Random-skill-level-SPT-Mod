# Random skill level and mastering
You're a professional PMC, not a baby

## [About](#about)

I really didn't like that we play for a PMC that went through many conflicts and didn't get any skills. This mod is designed to fix that because each person is individual in their skills, so each profile you create will have different skills.

You will no longer have to level up from scratch, your skills will be similar to the skills of a person who has completed training.

## A new profile is recommended!

This mod only changes the level of skills that are zero. Each new profile will have different skill levels


## [Installation](#installation)

1. Drag the `user` folder from the zip archive into the SPT installation folder.

## [How to configure](#how-to-configure)

After installing the mod, open the `config.json` file and set the value to true or falls for the selected skills.

`true` - random skill level

`false` - Skill will remain at the same progress level

## Vanilla `config.json`
